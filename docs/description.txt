ZSyncer
=======

ZSyncer is a project that allows live zope objects to be synchronized
from one Zope to another without doing the tedious export / transfer /
import dance. It is very easy to use. 

ZSyncer also allows you to see at a glance which objects are
out-of-sync.

ZSyncer also allows you to view a diff against the destination object,
for many types of objects.
